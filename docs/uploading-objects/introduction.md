To upload items, you must request upload capabilities.

  ![Request](Images/Request.jpg){ width="1024" }

Once the request is approved, a new object or collection can be added.

  ![Upload](Images/Upload.jpg){ width="1024" }

  Throughout the process of uploading an object, there will be instructions on what formats should be used. The object can be either a 3D model or an image, video or audio. Once the upload process is finished, the next step is to adjust the setting of the object. You will also need to adjust the setting by choosing the color, width and more.

  To upload an object or collection to Kompakkt, there are several formats to choose from. These formats include 3D models (.glb, .babylon, .gltf, .obj, .stl), images (.jpg, .jpg, .tga, .gif, .bmp), audio (.mp3, .wav, .ogg, .m4a) and video (.mp4, .webm, .ogv).
