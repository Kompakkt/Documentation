In order to upload objects, one needs to request upload capabilities.

Once the request has been approved, a new object or collection can be added. 

  ![Upload](Images/Upload.png){ width="800" }

  Through the process of uploading an object, there will be an instruction on what formats should be used. The object could be either a 3D model or an image, video or audio. Once the upload process has been finished, the next step is to do the setting of the object. Furthermore, one has to adjust the setting by choosing the color, width and more. 

  To upload an object or collection in Kompakkt, there are multiple formats available to choose from. These formats include 3D models (.glb, .babylon, .gltf, .obj, .stl), images (.jpg, .png, .tga, .gif, .bmp), audios (.mp3, .wav, .ogg, .m4a), and videos (.mp4, .webm, .ogv).
