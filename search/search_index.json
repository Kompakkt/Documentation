This will open a special page showing the object along with the relevant information associated with it.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Users can also select the \"Annotate\" option provided on the object page. When this option is selected, a brief description is displayed, providing the user with instructions on how to proceed with the annotation.</p> <p></p> <p>To create an annotation, users can double-click the object. This action triggers an on-screen prompt asking the user to enter a title and description for the annotation. Users have the flexibility to save, delete, or edit the annotation in full-screen mode, depending on their preferences and needs.</p> <p></p> <p>Once the user completes the annotation process, the title and description provided by the user are prominently displayed in a fixed area of the object.
